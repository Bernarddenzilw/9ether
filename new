1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/comprehensive-live-data-ai-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd comprehensive-live-data-ai-app
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   - For Node.js:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - For Python (if applicable):
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Usage
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Start the frontend application (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL)
- **APIs**: Google GPT, Twitter API, Wikipedia API, OpenWeatherMap API, NewsAPI, and other open-source data sources.

## Architecture
- The application utilizes a Microservices Architecture for scalability and independent service deployment.
- Each service is responsible for handling specific API requests and data aggregation from various sources.

## API Endpoints
- **GET /api/query**: Accepts user questions and returns answers by aggregating data from multiple integrated APIs.
- **POST /api/query**: Allows users to submit questions for processing and retrieves relevant information.

## Integration with Open Source APIs
This application pulls data from a diverse range of open-source APIs, ensuring comprehensive coverage for responding to user queries:

- **Google GPT**: Access natural language processing capabilities for intelligent response generation.
- **Twitter API**: Fetch real-time tweets and trends to provide current insights related to user queries.
- **Wikipedia API**: Retrieve summaries and articles to enhance the depth of information provided.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Offer real-time weather data based on user location or queries.
- **NewsAPI**: Aggregate the latest news articles and updates from various news sources.
- **YouTube Data API**: Pull video data and trends related to user queries.

### Example Code for API Integration
Here's a snippet demonstrating how to integrate these APIs:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function fetchFromAPIs(userQuery) {
    try {
        // Google GPT API call
        const gptResponse = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions', {
            prompt: userQuery,
            max_tokens: 150,
            headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer YOUR_GOOGLE_GPT_API_KEY` }
        });

        // Twitter API call
        const twitterResponse = await axios.get(`https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent?query=${userQuery}`, {
            headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer YOUR_TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN` }
        });

        // OpenWeatherMap API call
        const weatherResponse = await axios.get(`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=YOUR_CITY&appid=YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY`);

        // Combine and return results
        return {
            gptAnswer: gptResponse.data.choices[0].text,
            twitterData: twitterResponse.data.data,
            weatherData: weatherResponse.data
        };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data from APIs:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}
```

## Testing
- Unit tests are written using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure code quality.
- Integration tests verify that API endpoints return expected results and handle errors gracefully.
